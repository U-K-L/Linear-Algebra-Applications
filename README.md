# Linear Algebra Applications

I like to make application programs for math subjects to get a better understanding of the subject.

Here's a mandelbrot set which I've produce with code:  ![alt text](https://github.com/U-K-L/Linear-Algebra-Applications/blob/master/MathGraphs/MandlebrotS.png)

## Linear Algebra.
I've been playing with the basis vectors. Using those basis vectors I and J to continously transform a matrix.

For each of these images I changed the basis vectors, and produced different results.

A good look at pixel approximation. Depending on the zoom this image will constantly change shapes, and colors! Because the pixels are tightly packed, but are also slightly apart, making the computer needing to approximate where to place each coordinate on the screen.

Click it for it to transform!

# Well that's everything I've played with so far. Now back to studying!
